Statistics, David Freedman
### 1. Controlled Experiments
method of comparison
double-blind both subjects don't know whether they are in treatment or in
control; neither do those who evaluate the responses.

### 2. Observational Studies
hidden confounders are a major problem in observational studies.
confounding means a difference between the treatment and control groups-
other than the treatment-which affects the responses being studied.

### 3. The Histogram

### 4. The Average and the Standard Deviation

### 5. The Normal Approximation for Data

### 6. Measurement Error

### 7. Plotting Points and Lines

### 8. Correlation
correlation coefficient a measure of linear association, or clustering
around a line.
standard units f(average, standard deviation)

### 9. More about Correlation
The correlation coefficient is a pure number, without units.
The appearance of a scatter diagram depends on the SDs.
The correlation coefficient is useful for football-shaped scatter diagrams.
For other diagrams, r can be misleading. Outliers and non-linearity are
problem cases.
