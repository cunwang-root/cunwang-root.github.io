## 2. Git Basics
The git add command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if
it’s a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory
recursively.

It’s important to note that git diff by itself doesn’t show all changes
made since your last commit – only changes that are still unstaged. This can
be confusing, because if you’ve staged all of your changes, git diff will
give you no output.

git diff --cached to see what you’ve staged so far.

One useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working
tree but remove it from your staging area. In other words, you may want to
keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore.

git rm --cached README

You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the git rm
command. That means you can do things such as:

git rm log/\*.log

Note the backslash (\) in front of the \*. This is necessary because Git
does its own filename expansion in addition to your shell’s filename
expansion.
