## Chapter 1. What is Statistics
The large body of data that is the target of our interest is called the
_population_, and the subset selected from it is a _sample_.

The objective of statistics is to make an inference about a population based
on information contained in a sample from that population and to provide an 
associated measure of goodness for the inference.

1.2 Characterizing a Set of Measurements: Graphical Methods

1.3 Characterizing a Set of Measurements: Numerical Methods

We will confine our attention to two types of descriptive numbers:
_measures of central tendency_ and _measures of dispersion or variation_.

DEFINITION 1.1 mean
DEFINITION 1.2 The variance of sample of measurements $y_1, y_2, \ldots,
y_n$ is the sum of the square of the differences between the measurements
and their mean, divided by $n - 1$
$$
\begin{align} 
    s^2 =  \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
\end{align}
$$
