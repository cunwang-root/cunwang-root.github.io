relational sql

test for NULL values    to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators

Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses ROWNUM.

SQL Server
```sql
    SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
```
MYSQL
```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT number;
```
Oracle
```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE ROWNUM <= number;
```

The IN operator allows us to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
```

SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
An alias only exists for the duration of the query.

SQL UNION

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!

SQL HAVING

The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used
with aggregate functions.

SQL EXISTS

The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a
subquery. The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more
records.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

SQL ANY and ALL

The ANY and ALL operators are used with a WHERE or HAVING clause.
The ANY operator returns true if any of the subquery values meet the condition.
The ALL operator returns true if all of the subquery values meet the condition.

ANY Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

ALL Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ALL
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```
The operator must be a standard comparison operator.

Stored Procedure
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
sql_statement
GO;
```
Execute a Stored Procedure
```sql
EXEC procedure_name;
```

Example
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
GO;
```
